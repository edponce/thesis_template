\chapter*{Abstract} \label{ch:abstract}

The content of the abstract is determined by the student and committee,
the following information is appropriate: [1] a short statement concerning
the area of investigation, [2] a brief discussion of methods and procedures
used in gathering the data, [3] a condensed summary of the findings, and/or
[4] conclusions reached in the study.

The abstract will be used by the University of Tennessee Libraries in cataloguing
the thesis or dissertation. Therefore, the abstract must NOT exceed 350 words
in length. Furthermore, if the abstract contains any special characters
(those characters not found on typical English-language keyboards) the student
must also write out the term or concept in plain English in square brackets
immediately following the special character. For example: $\pi$ [pi].
If you have questions about what qualifies as a special character, please
check with the thesis/dissertation consultant.
