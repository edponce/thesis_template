\section{Literature Review} \label{lit-review}

A review of relevant literature is of great significance.
The literature review helps relate the proposed study to the larger ongoing
discourse in the literature about a phenomenon, filling in gaps in the
literature and extending earlier studies. The literature review is neither a
chronological summary of related works nor a mere catalogue of previous studies
published in the field. Literature review is a well-organized critical
appreciation of related and relevant literature conceptually integrated within
the logic of the proposed investigation. The student should show whether other
researchers have studied the same or similar problems before, from what
perspectives have these studies been conducted, and whether these researches
have been theoretically or empirically adequate.
