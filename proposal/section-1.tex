\section{Problem Statement} \label{problem}

Logically, the first step in any research is to provide a clear statement of
the problem. This step is indispensable in the writing process in that it
governs the organization and flow of the thesis/defense. The problem statement
should provide a synopsis of the purpose of the study, briefly define and
delimit the specific area of the research, and foreshadow the questions to be
raised. A problem may be stated in terms of a verbal statement, i.e., ``The
purpose of this research is to examine...'' or ``This study aims at
ascertaining ...'' Problem could also be stated in the form of a question
like: ``Why are Muslims divided?'' or ``What are the factors associated w ith
the rise of hate crime against Muslims in the West?''
