This is a citation~\cite{utk:idr2016optimization}.
This is a very short guide to an unofficial thesis/dissertation template
for the University of Tennessee\footnote{UTK is a public university in Knoxville,
TN}.
It is based on the 2017\footnote{The 2017 template was based on a 2016 template} thesis specifications but can be easily altered
as the guidelines are changed.
This template requires a basic knowledge of \LaTeX\ and should cover
the basic requirements in terms of required packages and functionality.

        The main LaTeX file and BibTeX file are in the top directory.
        All other files are placed in any of the four folders
        (back-matter, chapters, figures, front-matter).}

Again, in \autoref{fig:folderstructure2} is the folder structure.

\section{Details} \label{details}

\begin{equation}
    die\ yield = wafer\ yield \times \dfrac{1}{\left(1 + \dfrac{defects\ per\ unit\ area \times die\ area}{N}\right)^N}
    \label{eq:dieyield}
\end{equation}

Use the die yield model to obtain \cref{eq:dieyield}.
For multiple references use cref \cref{eq:dieyield,eq:dieyield}.

My life summary is found in \autoref{vita}.
