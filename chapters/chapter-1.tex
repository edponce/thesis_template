\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter1}

This is a guide to an unofficial thesis/dissertation template
for the University of Tennessee.
\mnote{Not sure when website specifications incomprehensibilities were updated.}
It is based on the 2017 \textit{Guide to the Preparation of Theses and Dissertations}
but can be easily altered as the guidelines are changed.
\mnote[1cm]{This is a margin note used during revisions, not the final draft.}
This template requires a basic knowledge of \LaTeX\ and should cover
the basic requirements in terms of required packages and functionality
for the University of Tennessee.
\note[green]{This is a note with custom color.}
\note{This is a note with default color.}
Figures should have at least 1.5in between text.

    \caption[UT thesis template folder structure]{UT thesis template folder structure.
        The main LaTeX file and BibTeX file are in the top directory.
        All other files are placed in any of the four folders
        (back-matter, chapters, figures, front-matter).}

The general structure of this template is based on the tree shown in~\autoref{fig:folderstructure}.
The titles of the folders are self descriptive
and should guide you to proper file placement.
Note that this is only a suggested model that could be
modified to fit your own organizational structure.

For multipart figures (e.g.,~\autoref{fig:shapes-rect}),
you need to use the package ``subcaption''.

Discussing some analysis results from~\autoref{tab:multirow}.
Use cref/Cref for multiple references~\Cref{fig:shapes-cube,fig:shapes-rect,fig:shapes-circle}.
Also use for equations use cref exclusively.
It all started at~\autoref{asection} and never ended~\dots
